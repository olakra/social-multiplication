This project is my personal attempt to understand and learn [microservices](https://microservices.io/) using [spring boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). The entire content of this project has been cloned/copied from the book [Learn Microservices with Spring Boot](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484231647) by [Mois√©s Macero](https://thepracticaldeveloper.com/). The only pivot that I have made is using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as my build tool and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) as my language. 

## Release Notes
### 0.0.1
- The Multiplication service contains a basic logic and the core Multiplication domain object.
